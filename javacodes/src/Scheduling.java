 * Your task in this problem is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs
 * in decreasing order of the difference (weight - length). Recall from lecture
 * that this algorithm is not always optimal. IMPORTANT: if two jobs have equal
 * difference (weight - length), you should schedule the job with higher weight
 * first. Beware: if you break ties in a different way, you are likely to get
 * the wrong answer. You should report the sum of weighted completion times of
 * the resulting schedule --- a positive integer --- in the box below.
