## Knapsack problem
## Input: n items - each has a value:
## - value v (nonnegative)
## - size w (nonnegative and integral)
## - capacity W (nonnegative integer)

## Output:  a subset S of the initial group that maximizes the sum of vs in S
##  subject to the constraint that the sum of the sizes (ws) is less than or equal to 
##  the capacity W
